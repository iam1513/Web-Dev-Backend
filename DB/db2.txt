delete from <table_name> where (comparison...)
delete from second where Gender = "Other"; ---> The data with gender other will be deleted

delete from <table_name> ---> Will delete whole data but wont delete the table

update <table_name> set <column_name> = value 1 where {conditions.....};

New database :- 
insert into third (id,name,age,salary) Values("1","Om",19,100000.00),("2","Prachi",17,110000.00),("3","Vivek",18,90000.00);

update third set Name = "Akash", salary = 180000 where id="3"; ---> Now Vivek will be replaced with Akash

alter table <table_name> change <old_column_name> <new_column_name> [new constraint (datatype or constraint)]
alter table third change id em_no int; --->  Now "id" column will change to "em_no" and datatype will be changed to "int" from "char"

alter table <table_name> add <column_name> [parameters - datatype and contraint]
alter table third add Occuption VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT "Software Engineer"; ---> Will create a new column with DEFAULT value "Software engineer"

update third set Salary = 200000 where em_no = 4; ---> Salary of Aditya(em_no 4) will be updated 

update third set occupation = "Developer" where em_no < 4; ---> For every em_id < 4, occupation will be "Developer"

alter table third add speciality default "Null"; ---> We added another column Speciality wwith default value NULL
if we dont want this column anymore , we can just say 
"alter table third drop speciality;" ---> Speciality will be no more part of table

"select em_no as "Employee ID" from third;" ---> Now , em_no will become readable as Employee ID
"It won't be changed though"

We added new column last name with default "Shelke" and then individualy changed everyones lastname;

Now,if we want both full name together
"select concat(name," ",lastname) as FullName from third; "  ---> "Will give full_name as 'Om Shelke'"
